Julian is doing an internship in the Velten Group. He is enrolled in the master "Molecular Biosciences" in the "Developmental and Stem Cell biology" major.
His goal for the rotation will be to generate a workflow to use MEFISTO on spatial transcriptomics data. 
In his free time, Julian likes hanging out with friends and playing Guitar and Bass.
