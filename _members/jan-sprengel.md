Jan is a scientific programmer in the Velten lab. He completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics with emphasis on computational and statistical physics at Heidelberg University.

In his master's thesis Jan worked with Machine-Learning-based Causal Inference methods, which make use of single-cell RNA transcription data including targeted interventions, to study gene regulatory networks in cells and gain further insight into the complex biological processes taking place.

He works as a scientific programmer in the Velten Lab to maintain and develop bioinformatics software such as MOFA.

Apart from his studies, he enjoys outdoor activities including running and climbing. He also likes to do photography or to read a good book.
