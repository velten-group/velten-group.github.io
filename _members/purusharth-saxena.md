Purusharth is a PhD student at Velten Lab in Universit√§t Heidelberg. He did his master's in Scientific Computing (Heidelberg) and his research interests include mathematical modeling with partial differential equations, uncertainty quantification, and optimal transport. In the second and third quarter of 2024, he received a scholarship to work with Optimal Experimental Design and Monte Carlo algorithms at OvGU. His current PhD project is focused on developing mathematical models using Optimal Transport and Causal Inference methods for single-cell data.

Beyond the usual, he has a keen interest in logistical networks and cartography and often unwinds with cooking and board games.
