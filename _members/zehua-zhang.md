Zehua obtained his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Mathematics from the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the AG Velten group. His research interests focus on deep learning and gene regulation. His Master's thesis involved using heterogeneous graph neural networks to integrate matched multi-omics data, and constructing cell type-specific regulatory networks by incorporating transcriptional regulatory prior knowledge.

His Ph.D. project will continue in this direction, focusing on constructing dynamic gene regulatory networks based on multi-omics data collected from the muscle development process in Drosophila. By observing changes in regulatory patterns, the project aims to provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying muscle development.

Outside of work, he is a professional Go player and enjoys music and playing the guitar, especially rock music. In terms of sports, he likes playing basketball, table tennis, and badminton.
