Fabian is a master's student in the lab of Britta Velten. After receiving his bachelor's degree in physics from Heidelberg University, he is currently pursuing his master's degree specializing in computational physics & machine learning.

His research in the Velten lab focuses on spatial omics. In his thesis, he develops generative models to learn subcellular transcript distributions. The goal of the project is to gain a better understanding of the complex processes shaping subcellular RNA localization.

In his free time, he enjoys good food, movies, and music.
