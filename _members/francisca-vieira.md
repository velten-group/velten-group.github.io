Francisca Gaspar Vieira is a PhD student in the Velten lab. She is doing her PhD as a fellow member of the PhD program of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS), advised by Dr. Britta Velten (in the Centre for Organismal Studies, Heidelberg University) and co-advised by Dr. Julio Saez-Rodriguez (in EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute). Francisca holds an Integrated Master’s degree in Biological Engineering and a second Master's degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. In her first master’s thesis, she spent six months in the Laboratory of Gene Technology in KU Leuven investigating bacteriophage genomics and biocontrol, while during the second master’s thesis she explored multi-omics integration and classification of glioma types. 

In her PhD project, Francisca develops statistical methods and computational tools for the inference and comparison of perturbation responses from single-cell CRISPR screens across different biological contexts with a particular focus on time course data.

Outside of work, Francisca likes theatre, literature, cinema, to travel with friends and spend time with her family.
