George is an intern in the Velten lab who completed his bachelor's degree in Biology at the National & Kapodistrian University of Athens. Currently, he pursues his master's studies in "Molecular Biosciences" at Heidelberg University, specializing in Developmental & Stem Cell Biology.
During his internship he will work on the analysis of single-cell time-course data from perturbation CRISPR screens on a Zebrafish dataset, to investigate how genetic perturbations influence developmental programs in different cell types.
On his free time he likes spending time with friends and family, car and bike rides and photography.
